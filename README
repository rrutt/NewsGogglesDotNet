News Goggles - Rules Engine in Prolog and C#

  "News Goggles" is the name of an imaginary web site focused on daily
  news feeds. A proof-of-concept rules engine uses Prolog and Java integration
  to apply matchmaker rules. These rules dispatch news feeds to
  readers based on their personal preferences.

  This demonstration rules engine uses tuProlog (also known as 2p) 
  from the University of Bologna.

  To run the demo, open a command-prompt (terminal) window and navigate 
  to the out sub-folder, containing the JAR files. 
  Enter one of the following commands. 
  The program will process rules, display progress messages and results, and then exit.
  
    java -jar NewsGoggles.jar
  
    java -jar NewsGoggles.jar -trace
    
    java -jar NewsGoggles.jar -test

  For more information, open the NewsGoggles.html file from the doc sub-folder
  in any web browser.
